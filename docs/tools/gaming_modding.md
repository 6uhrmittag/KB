### problems caused by up NET 6.0 runtime (in 2023)

As far as I understood due to some changes by the .NET runtime around 2023, many mods and plugins had to rewritten/updated and still have issues.  
The result is that even some of the universal mods listed in the MelonLoader Wiki are not working anymore. Check GitHub issues for alternatives.

### universal mods

- https://melonwiki.xyz/#/universalmods
- UnityExplorer
    - the default is archived and doesn't seem to work: - https://github.com/GrahamKracker/UnityExplorer
    - see https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/issues/565
    - the Fork seem to work https://github.com/GrahamKracker/UnityExplorer?tab=readme-ov-file
