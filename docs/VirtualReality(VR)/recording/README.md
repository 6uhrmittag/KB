# Recording in VR

## Tools and ways to record VR

- **OBS-OpenVR-Input-Plugin** _[easiest since in OBS directly]_
    - https://github.com/baffler/OBS-OpenVR-Input-Plugin
    - OBS page includes a few instructions for cropping: https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/openvr-input-plugin.534/
- **SteamVR Mirror Window** _[a bit more convinient]_
    - plain capture via OBS Game Capture
- **Metas Debugging tools to record**(*more or less all the same, IMHO offering the most advanced settings, no audio)*
    - OculusMirror.exe _[I believe wired only?!]_
        - https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/native/pc/dg-compositor-mirror/
    - Meta Quest Developer Hub (MQDH) _[wireless casting via BetaCast 2.0]_

        - https://www.vr-wave.store/de-de/blogs/virtual-reality-prescription-lenses/how-to-record-gameplay-on-the-meta-quest-3
- **built-in Quest wireless casting** _[requires to cast to Firefox to capture with OBS, rather lame solution]_
    - https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/in-vr-experiences/oculus-features/cast-with-quest/
- **built-in Quest recording** _[convenient, adds min. 5ms latency in my experiments]_
    - https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/in-vr-experiences/social-features-and-sharing/record-video-oculus/
- **Sidequest to enhance built-in casting/recording** _[improves performance + quality]_
    - enhanced quality for local recording enhanced quality for wireless casting (no audio I believe)
    - ability to set CPU+GPU to max. level for optimization
    - mirroring via scrcpy, but not worth it having all other options
- **LIV** _[adds nothing for plain recording, but a bit more convenient, adds more advanced features]_

## Recording custom avatars in VR (VRChat avatars/FBX/VRM)

As of 2024/2025 there are just 2+1/2 ways to record custom avatars in VR:

- LIV (built-in avatar feature + image combination)
    - https://help.liv.tv/hc/en-us/sections/360004620060-LIV-Avatars-and-Virtual-Cameras
    - Notes:
        - Avatars are displayed in very low quality compared to the original. VMC's quality is much better.
        - LIV offers lots of useful features
- LIV(image combination) + VMC(avatar)
    - VMC

    - Demos
        - VMC and Synth Riders:
            - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE-qsOfweM4
    - Hack: use Quest Passthrough with any game by using Virtual Desktops greenscreen feature
        - by combining Virtual Desktop's greenscreen chromakey feature + any game that includes green/blue screen levels(e.g. a greenroom world in VRChat)

                - Artur's Tech Tales - Mixed Reality Passthrough - Blending Realities & Virtual Desktop Set-Up
- Games with built-in avatar support
    - Synth Riders has a built-in avatar feature
        - unfortunately no FBT support, so no legs+hips
        - better quality than LIV's avatar feature
    - Beat Saber [untested by me]
        - built-in feature
        - mods to integrate with VMC [seems very good/advanced]
            - integrates with advanced camera mods like Camera2

    - VRChat [obviously]
